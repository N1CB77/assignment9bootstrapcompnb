          The Space Race was an informal competition between the United States
          and the Soviet Union to see who could make the furthest advancements
          into space first. It involved the efforts to explore outer space with
          artificial satellites, to send man into space, and to land him on the
          Moon.

              On July 29, 1957, in recognition of the 1957-1958 International
              Geophysical Year, the White House announced that the U.S. intended
              to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as

              unmanned lunar rovers landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as
              part of its Lunokhod program. The spacecraft which carried

              Luna 17 was launched on November 10, 1970 at 14:44:01 UTC. After

            <h2>End of the Space Race</h2>
            <p>
              The 17 July 1975 rendezvous of the Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft
              traditionally marks the end of the Space Race
            </p>
            <p>
              While the Sputnik 1 launch can clearly be called the start of the
              Space Race, its end is more debatable. Most hotly contested during
              the 1960s, the Space Race continued apace through the U.S. Apollo
              moon landing of 1969. Although they followed Apollo 11 with five
              more manned lunar landings, American space scientists turned to
              new arenas. Skylab was to gather data, and the Space Shuttle was
              intended to return spaceships intact from space journeys.
